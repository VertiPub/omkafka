# New tests should be added to this file if there is no specific
# reason for not doing that. Initially, we could only handle one test
# case per file, but this restriction has been removed some time ago.
# So it is less troublesome (and easier to overlook) to have all related
# tests in a single file.
# This file contains a lot of real-life samples (of course mangled so
# that they can not be traced back to the original submitter). Note
# that IP addr 192.0.2.1 is specifically set aside for testing and
# documentation by IANA.
