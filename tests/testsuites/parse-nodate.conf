# test is a test config that does not include the timestamp. This is necessary to
# test some illformed messages that do not contain a date. In that case, the system's
# current timestamp is used, and that of course is a bit hard to compare against
# a fixed template. So the solution in this case is to use a format that does
# not contain any timestamp. Maybe not optimal, but it works ;)
