# This test some real-world snare cases. I don't like snare (no wonder
# as I have written EventReporter, the ultimate Windows-to-Syslog tool),
# but besides that snare generates severely malformed messages that
# really stress-test the rsyslog engine. They deserve to be beaten by someone ;)
# This test needs to be run over UDP only, as snare puts LF INTO some of the messages,
# which makes it impossible to try these out via traditional syslog/tcp
