# New tests should be added to this file if there is no specific
# reason for not doing that. Initially, we could only handle one test
# case per file, but this restriction has been removed some time ago.
# So it is less troublesome (and easier to overlook) to have all related
# tests in a single file.
# the actual message is not important. There is an error inside the conf
# file, and all messages will trigger the same problem.
# NOTE: it is correct that the "BAD REGULAR EXPRESSION" error message is
# *NOT* run through the rest of the propety replace, in specific through
# the CSV escaper. We do not do this because it could potentially lead
# to an obfuscated error message, and thus making problems hard to find. As
# this is a real error case, there is no problem in not obeying to the 
# configured format.
