/* Definition of globally-accessible data items.
 *
 * This module provides access methods to items of global scope. Most often,
 * these globals serve as defaults to initialize local settings. Currently,
 * many of them are either constants or global variable references. However,
 * this module provides the necessary hooks to change that at any time.
 *
 * Please note that there currently is no glbl.c file as we do not yet
 * have any implementations.
