/* rgerhards 2004-11-08: The following structure represents a
 * syslog message. 
 *
 * Important Note:
 * The message object is used for multiple purposes (once it
 * has been created). Once created, it actully is a read-only
 * object (though we do not specifically express this). In order
 * to avoid multiple copies of the same object, we use a
 * reference counter. This counter is set to 1 by the constructer
 * and increased by 1 with a call to MsgAddRef(). The destructor
 * checks the reference count. If it is more than 1, only the counter
 * will be decremented. If it is 1, however, the object is actually
 * destroyed. To make this work, it is vital that MsgAddRef() is
 * called each time a "copy" is stored somewhere.
 *
 * WARNING: this structure is not calloc()ed, so be careful when
 * adding new fields. You need to initialize them in
 * msgBaseConstruct(). That function header comment also describes
 * why this is the case.
