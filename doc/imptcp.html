<h1>Plain TCP Syslog Input Module</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imptcp</b></p>
<p><b>Available since: </b>4.7.3+, 5.5.8+
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards
&lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>Provides the ability to receive syslog messages via plain  TCP syslog.
This is a specialised input plugin tailored for high performance on Linux. It will
probably not run on any other platform. Also, it does no provide TLS services.
Encryption can be provided by using <a href="rsyslog_stunnel.html">stunnel</a>.
<p>This module has no limit on the number of listeners and sessions that can be used.
<p>Multiple receivers may be configured by
specifying $InputPTCPServerRun multiple times.
</p>
<p><b>Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
<p>This plugin has config directives similar named as imtcp, but they all have <b>P</b>TCP in
their name instead of just TCP. Note that only a subset of the parameters are supported.
<ul>
<li>$InputPTCPServerAddtlFrameDelimiter &lt;Delimiter&gt;<br>
This directive permits to specify an additional frame delimiter for plain tcp syslog.
The industry-standard specifies using the LF character as frame delimiter. Some vendors,
notable Juniper in their NetScreen products, use an invalid frame delimiter, in Juniper's
case the NUL character. This directive permits to specify the ASCII value of the delimiter
in question. Please note that this does not guarantee that all wrong implementations can
be cured with this directive. It is not even a sure fix with all versions of NetScreen,
as I suggest the NUL character is the effect of a (common) coding error and thus will
probably go away at some time in the future. But for the time being, the value 0 can
probably be used to make rsyslog handle NetScreen's invalid syslog/tcp framing.
For additional information, see this
<a href="http://kb.monitorware.com/problem-with-netscreen-log-t1652.html">forum thread</a>.
<br><b>If this doesn't work for you, please do not blame the rsyslog team. Instead file
a bug report with Juniper!</b>
<br>Note that a similar, but worse, issue exists with Cisco's IOS implementation. They do
not use any framing at all. This is confirmed from Cisco's side, but there seems to be
very limited interest in fixing this issue. This directive <b>can not</b> fix the Cisco bug.
That would require much more code changes, which I was unable to do so far. Full details
can be found at the <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/Article321.phtml">Cisco tcp syslog anomaly</a>
page.
<li>$InputPTCPServerNotifyOnConnectionClose [on/<b>off</b>]<br>
instructs imptcp to emit a message if the remote peer closes a connection.<br>
<li>$InputPTCPServerRun &lt;port&gt;<br>
Starts a TCP server on selected port</li>
<li>$InputPTCPServerInputName &lt;name&gt;<br>
Sets a name for the inputname property. If no name is set "imptcp" is used by default. Setting a 
name is not strictly necessary, but can be useful to apply filtering based on which input
the message was received from.
<li>$InputPTCPServerBindRuleset &lt;name&gt;<br>
Binds specified ruleset to next server defined.
<li>$InputPTCPServerListenIP &lt;name&gt;<br>
On multi-homed machines, specifies to which local address the next listerner should
be bound.
</ul>
<b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<ul>
<li>module always binds to all interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sample:</b></p>
<p>This sets up a TCP server on port 514:<br>
