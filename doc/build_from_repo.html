<h1>Building rsyslog from the source repository</h1>
<p>In most cases, people install rsyslog either via a package or use an "official"
distribution tarball to generate it. But there may be situations where it is desirable
to build directly from the source repository. This is useful for people who would like to
participate in development or who would like to use the latest, not-yet-released code.
The later may especially be the case if you are asked to try out an experimental version.
<p>Building from the repsitory is not much different than building from the source
tarball, but some files are missing because they are output files and thus do not
belong into the repository.
<h2>Obtaining the Source</h2>
<p>First of all, you need to download the sources. Rsyslog is currently kept in a git
repository. You can clone this repository either via http or git protocol (with the later
being much faster. URLS are:
<ul>
<li>git://git.adiscon.com/git/rsyslog.git
<li>http://git.adiscon.com/git/rsyslog.git
</ul>
<p>There is also a browsable version (gitweb) available at
<a href="http://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=summary">http://git.adiscon.com/?p=rsyslog.git;a=summary</a>.
This version also offers snapshots of each commit for easy download. You can use these if
you do not have git present on your system.
<p>After you have cloned the repository, you are in the master branch by default. This
is where we keep the devel branch. If you need any other branch, you need to do
a "git checkout --track -b branch origin/branch". For example, the command to check out
the beta branch is "git checkout --track -b beta origin/beta".
<h2>Prequisites</h2>
<p>To build the compilation system, you need the <b>pkg-config</b> package (an utility for
autotools) present on your system. Otherwise, configure will fail with something like
<pre><code>
checking for SYSLOG_UNIXAF support... yes
checking for FSSTND support... yes
./configure: line 25895: syntax error near unexpected token `RELP,'
./configure: line 25895: ` PKG_CHECK_MODULES(RELP, relp >= 0.1.1)'
</code></pre>
<h2>Creating the Build Environment</h2>
<p>This is fairly easy: just issue "<b>autoreconf -fvi</b>", which should do everything you need.
Once this is done, you can follow the usual ./configure steps just like when
you downloaded an official distribution tarball (see the
<a href="install.html">rsyslog install guide</a>, starting at step 2,
for further details about that).

<h2>Special Compile-Time Options</h2>
<p>On some platforms, compile-time issues occur, like the one shown below:
<p><pre><code>
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/az/RSyslog/rsyslog-5.5.0/tools'
  CCLD   rsyslogd
rsyslogd-omfile.o: In function `getClockFileAccess':
/home/az/RSyslog/rsyslog-5.5.0/tools/omfile.c:91: undefined reference to `__sync_fetch_and_add_8'
/home/az/RSyslog/rsyslog-5.5.0/tools/omfile.c:91: undefined reference to `__sync_fetch_and_add_8'
/home/az/RSyslog/rsyslog-5.5.0/tools/omfile.c:91: undefined reference to `__sync_fetch_and_add_8'
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the exact error messages can be different. These type of errors stem down to
atomic instruction support in GCC, which is somewhat depending on the machine architecture it
compiles code for. Very old machines (like the original i386) do not even at all provide support
for these instructions.
<p>The availability of atomic instructions is vital for rsyslog - it can not be built without them.
Consequently, there is a configure check included for them. But under some circumstances,
GCC seems to report they are available, but does not provide implementations for
all of them (at least this is my observation...). The simple cure is to make sure that
GCC generates code for a modern-enough architecture. This, for example, can be done as
follows:
<p><pre><code>
./configure CFLAGS="-march=i586 -mcpu=i686" --enable-imfile ... (whatever you need)
</code></pre>
<p>These settings should resolve the issue .
