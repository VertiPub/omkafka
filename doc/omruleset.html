<h1>ruleset output/including module (omruleset)</h1>
<p><b>Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; omruleset</b></p>
<p><b>Author: </b>Rainer Gerhards &lt;rgerhards@adiscon.com&gt;</p>
<p><b>Available Since</b>: 5.3.4</p>
<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
<p>This is a very special &quot;output&quot; module.  It permits to pass a message object
to another rule set. While this is a very simple action, it enables very
complex configurations, e.g. it supports high-speed "and" conditions, sending
data to the same file in a non-racy way, include-ruleset functionality as well as
some high-performance optimizations (in case the rule sets have the necessary
queue definitions).
<p>While it leads to a lot of power, this output module offers seamingly easy functionaltiy.
The complexity (and capablities) arise from how everthing can be combined.
<p>With this module, a message can be sent to processing to another ruleset. This is somewhat
similar to a &quot;#include&quot; in the C programming language. However, one needs to keep
on the mind that a ruleset can contain its own queue and that a queue can run in various modes.
<p>Note that if no queue is defined in the ruleset, the message is enqueued into the main message
queue. This most often is not optimal and means that message processing may be severely defered.
Also note that when the ruleset's target queue is full and no free space can be aquired 
within the usual timeout, the message object may actually be lost. This is an extreme scenario,
but users building an audit-grade system need to know this restriction. For regular installations,
it should not really be relevant.
<p><b>At minimum, be sure you understand the
<a href="rsconf1_rulesetcreatemainqueue.html">$RulesetCreateMainQueue</a>
directive as well as the importance of statement order in rsyslog.conf before using omruleset!</b>
<p><b>Recommended Use:</b> 
<ul>
<li>create rulesets specifically for omruleset
<li>create these rulesets with their own main queue
<li> decent queueing parameters (sizes, threads, etc) should be used
for the ruleset main queue. If in doubt, use the same parameters as for the 
overall main queue.
<li>if you use multiple levels of ruleset nesting, double check for endless loops - the rsyslog
engine does not detect these
</ul>

<p><b>Configuration Directives</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>$ActionOmrulesetRulesetName</b> ruleset-to-submit-to<br>
This directive specifies the name of the ruleset that the message
provided to omruleset should be submitted to. This ruleset must already have
been defined. Note that the directive is automatically reset after each
:omruleset: action and there is no default. This is done to prevent accidential
loops in ruleset definition, what can happen very quickly.
The :omruleset: action will NOT be honored if no ruleset name has been defined. As usual,
the ruleset name must be specified in front of the action that it modifies.
</ul>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>This example creates a ruleset for a write-to-file action. The idea here
is that the same file is written based on multiple filters, problems occur if the file is used
together with a buffer. That is because file buffers are action-specific, and so some partial
buffers would be written. With omruleset, we create a single action inside its own ruleset and
then pass all messages to it whenever we need to do so. Of course, such a simple situation could
also be solved by a more complex filter, but the method used here can also be utilized in
more complex scenarios (e.g. with multiple listeners). The example tries to keep it simple.
Note that we create a ruleset-specific main queue (for simplicity with the default main queue 
parameters) in order to avoid re-queueing messages back into the main queue.

<textarea rows="30" cols="80">$ModLoad omruleset

# define ruleset for commonly written file
$RuleSet commonAction
$RulesetCreateMainQueue on
*.* /path/to/file.log

#switch back to default ruleset
$ruleset RSYSLOG_DefaultRuleset

# begin first action
# note that we must first specify which ruleset to use for omruleset:
$ActionOmrulesetRulesetName CommonAction
mail.info :omruleset:
#end first action

# begin second action
# note that we must first specify which ruleset to use for omruleset:
$ActionOmrulesetRulesetName CommonAction
:FROMHOST, isequal, "myhost.example.com" :omruleset:
#end second action

# of course, we can have "regular" actions alongside :omrulset: actions
*.* /path/to/general-message-file.log
</textarea>
<p>The next example is used to creat a high-performance nested and filter condition. Here,
it is first checked if the message contains a string &quot;error&quot;. If so, the message is forwarded
to another ruleset which then applies some filters. The advantage of this is that we can use
high-performance filters where we otherwise would need to use the (much slower) expression-based
filters. Also, this enables pipeline processing, in that second ruleset is executed in
parallel to the first one.</p>

<p><b>Caveats/Known Bugs:</b>
<p>The current configuration file language is not really adequate for a complex construct
like omruleset. Unfortunately, more important work is currently preventing me from redoing the
config language. So use extreme care when nesting rulesets and be sure to test-run your
config before putting it into production, ensuring you have a suffciently large probe
of the traffic run over it. If problems arise, the
<a href="troubleshoot.html">rsyslog debug log</a> is your friend.
