<a href="rsyslog_conf_global.html">rsyslog.conf configuration directive</a>

<h2>$RulesetCreateMainQueue</h2>
<p><b>Type:</b> ruleset-specific configuration directive</p>
<p><b>Parameter Values:</b> boolean (on/off, yes/no)</p>
<p><b>Available since:</b> 5.3.5+</p>
<p><b>Default:</b> off</p>
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p>
Rulesets may use their own &quot;main&quot; message queue for message submission. Specifying
this directive, <b>inside a ruleset definition</b>, turns this on. This is both a performance
enhancement and also permits different rulesets (and thus different inputs within the same
rsyslogd instance) to use different types of main message queues.
<p>The ruleset queue is created with the parameters that are specified for the main message
queue at the time the directive is given. If different queue configurations are desired,
different main message queue directives must be used in front of the $RulesetCreateMainQueue
directive. Note that this directive may only be given once per ruleset. If multiple statements
are specified, only the first is used and for the others error messages are emitted.
<p>Note that the final set of ruleset configuration directives specifies the parameters for
the default main message queue.
<p>To learn more about this feature, please be sure to read about
<a href="multi_ruleset.html">multi-ruleset support in rsyslog</a>.
<p><b>Caveats:</b></p>
The configuration statement &quot;$RulesetCreateMainQueue off&quot; has no effect at all.
The capability to specify this is an artifact of the current (ugly!) configuration 
language.

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<p>This example sets up a tcp server with three listeners. Each of these
three listener is bound to a specific ruleset. As a performance optimization,
the rulesets all receive their own private queue. The result is that received messages
can be independently processed. With only a single main message queue, we would have
some lock contention between the messages. This does not happen here. Note that in this
example, we use different processing. Of course, all messages could also have been
processed in the same way ($IncludeConfig may be useful in that case!).

<p>Note the positions of the directives. With the current config language,
position is very important. This is ugly, but unfortunately the way it currently
works.
